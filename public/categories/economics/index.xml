      <description>Monetary Stance in the U.S.The Natural Interest Rate (R-Star)The natural interest rate or r-star is commonly defied as the long-term interest rate such that monetary policy is consistent sustained maximum employment and inflation at its longer-run objective.1 Also it’s sometimes defined as the interest rate that would preveil in a steady state where prices are fully flexible and inflation is zero (Woodford, 2003). However, the approach that I will take here is the one put forward by Holston, Lauback and Williams (2017) which is more an equilibrium concept that uses a time series approach.</description>
