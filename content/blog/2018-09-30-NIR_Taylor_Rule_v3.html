<h5><strong>The Natural Interest Rate (R-Star)</strong></h5>
<p>The natural interest rate or r-star is commonly defied as the long-term interest rate such that monetary policy is consistent sustained maximum employment and inflation at its longer-run objective.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Also it’s sometimes defined as the interest rate that would preveil in a steady state where prices are fully flexible and inflation is zero (Woodford, 2003). However, the approach that I will take here is the one put forward by Holston, Lauback and Williams (2017) which is more an equilibrium concept that uses a time series approach.</p>
<p>It’s imporant to note that this <span class="math inline">\(r_{t}^{*}\)</span> variable is attached to slow-moving forces that hardly change except when there is a big disruption in the economy. As an example, these are the forces that can affect the natural interest rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in labor productivity that affect the amount of labor supplied or the return on investment</li>
<li>Household’s desire to save or to realocate current consumption from the future</li>
<li>Public debt or government consumption that affect the use of aggregate savings in the economy</li>
<li>Capital flows, that is, the amount of financial resources coming from the rest of the world</li>
<li>The risk premia that the savers would like to received in return for their borrowed assets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Taylor Rule (inertial)</h3>
<hr />
<p>The Taylor Rule originally proposed by John B. Taylor is a prescription for the level of federal funds rate such that the monetary policy supports price stability and sustain GDP growth. The general formulation of the rule is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R^{T}_{t} = \rho R^{T}_{t-1} + (1 - \rho) [ r^{*} + \bar{\pi}_t + \beta ( \pi_{t} - \bar{\pi}_t ) + \gamma x_{t} ],\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R^{T}_{t}\)</span> is the federal funds prescribed rate in quarter t, <span class="math inline">\(r_t^{*}\)</span> is the natural interest rate estimated above, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{t}\)</span> is the four-quarter inflation rate, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\pi}_t\)</span> is the central bank’s objective for inflation, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{t}\)</span> measures the percentage difference of GDP from its potential level or output gap. The <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> parameter is a measure of persistence that smooths the series to make gradual adjustments in the policy rate, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the weight on the inflation gap and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> the weight on the output gap.</p>
